## Run/Fork it for yourself
This project is made to be compatible to run on [Repl.it](https://repl.it). 
To run this bot on the [Repl.it](https://repl.it) cloud. Please do the following:
1. Download entire code and upload it to the [Repl.it](https://repl.it) instance.
2. Run the main python file and use other services to keep the server alive (by constantly accessing the website that [Repl.it](https://repl.it) created for you, I recommend [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com))
